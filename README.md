# Zed Gruvbox Material Neovim
---

This is a port from [f4z3r's neovim gruvbox material](https://github.com/f4z3r/gruvbox-material.nvim/tree/master) pallete for the [Zed editor](https://zed.dev/).

I really liked the pallete from that theme and decided to port it over to zed. The syntax mappings for some types in zed are limited so they are not the exact same however, but I think it's similar enough. For example the `#include` token in c is default labeled explicitly purple in neovim gruvbox material, but in this extension, it is mapped to the `keyword` type of token which I set to red.

Feel free to let me know if there are any issues with the theme under specific use cases.
